                    <li><h4>Friends</h4></li>
                    <p> It is very heartbreaking when you found out that your friend died because of suicide.
                        Even if you are not related at all, you may still find 
                        that you are deeply affected by the suicide of him or her.If they were a close friend you will grieve 
                        for their loss and may wonder if you could have done something to prevent their death.
                        This may affect the person's confidence.

                    <li><h4>Family members</h4></li>
                    <p> Family members may feel guilty after their loved ones commits suicide.
                        <ul>

                                For siblings,when a person lose a brother or a sister,he will feel like he lose a person
                                who shared a lot of experiences and memories and who may have expected to be with him
                                for most of his life.Siblings share a deep connection.The siblings may feel hopeless and disappointed
                                because they could not stop the tragedy.Siblings may find that they become isolated in the family.
                                Twins may feel an even more extreme sense of loss emotionally or physically and may feel further isolated 
                                as so few will have a shared understanding of their experience.

                                For parents, the death of a child is the most painful loss imaginable. 
                                For parents who've lost a child to suicide, the pain and grief can be intensified. 
                                These feelings may never completely go away.According to the research, it suggest that 
                                parents who lose an child to suicide have increased rates of mental disorders, specifically 
                                depression and anxiety.They might think that there was something that they could have done to 
                                prevent their loved oneâ€™s death. Anger is another common emotion that family and friends have 
                                when someone commits suicide. Because there is a lot of stigma about suicide, the parents might 
                                feel embarrassment or shame and be reluctant to talk to others about what happened.

                        left feeling guilty for not noticing, not asking more questions, 
                        not encouraging the person to get professional help or not being a 
                        listening ear by understanding the extent of the emotional pain of 
                        the person who completed suicide.The guilt that put on the community 
                        left behind is a tremendous emotional burden.Most suicide are preventable.
                        Community should be alert and concern with people around themselves in order
