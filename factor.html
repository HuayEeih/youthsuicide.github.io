                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Personality characteristics</h4></li>
                    <p> Young people who committed suicide were found to 
                        have had poorer problem-solving skills than their peers. 
                        Their behavior was characterized by a rather passive attitude, 
                        waiting for someone else to solve the problems for them, no matter 
                        simple problems or complex interpersonal problems.There is a way of 
                        thinking, known as "dichotomy thinking" found in these young people.
                        It means that these young people think in terms of best and worst 
                        without accepting the possibilities that lie between these two extremes.
                        .This inability in problem solving and mood regulation often causes insecurity
                        and low self-esteem, but it can also lead to suicidal crisis.

                            <p> Communication between family members plays an important role in our life.
                                Direct conflicts with parents have a great impact on young people's feelings and emotions. 
                                Furthermore, violence at home often seems to be found in the background history of young 
                                suicide cases, not only specifically against the child, but more as a way of 
                                dealing with problems between family members.

                        <li><h5>Parental divorce</h5></li>
                        <p> According to the study found that men from divorced families had more than three times the odds of 
                            suicidal ideation in comparison to men whose parents had not divorced. Adult daughters 
                            of divorce had 83 per cent higher odds of suicidal ideation than their female peers who 
                            had not experienced parental divorce.Parental divorce can affect children socially.Young people tend to have less 
                            social contact with others. Sometimes they feel insecure and wonder if their family is the only family that has 
                            gotten divorced.

                    <p> Most studies agree that suicide is closely linked to mental disorders.
                        Mental disorders are found to contribute between 47 and 74% of suicide risk. 
                        Eating disorders, specifically anorexia nervosa, have the highest mortality 
                        rate out of all mental health disorders. Studies have shown that individuals 
                        with anorexia nervosa have the highest successful suicide rates and greatest number 
                        of suicide attempts.They may feel hopeless,have feelings of being emotional trapped and 
                        feel as if they are a burden resulting in suicidal thoughts and attempts.
